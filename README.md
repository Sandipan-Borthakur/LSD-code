# LSD-code
This code is using the LSD code by Colin Folsom (https://github.com/folsomcp/LSDpy). The goal of the code is to determine the chi-square distribution of vsini and vmac values for an observed spectrum.

Goals -
1. Generate synthetic spectrum and add noise to it to simulate observed spectrum.
2. Estimate chi-square distribution for vsini and vmac.
3. Plot the chi-square distribution.
4. Build a GUI for easy use.
5. Apply fourier transform to the LSD profile.
